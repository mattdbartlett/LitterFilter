# LitterFilter
An automated dust filter for cat litter boxes. 

This software is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi (Zero W). It interfaces with hardware over I2C. Specifically it uses the following hardware from Sparkfun

COM-15093	QWIIC Relay - An I2C controlled relay
SEN-17374	PIR sensor - An I2C interface Passive IR (PIR) sensor for detecting "occupancy"

The relay is used to turn on a 12 volt fan.
